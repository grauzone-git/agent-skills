# ADR Format

## Decide whether an ADR qualifies

Create an ADR only when all three conditions hold:

1. **Hard to reverse** - changing the decision later has meaningful cost.
2. **Surprising without context** - a future reader will wonder why the code takes this shape.
3. **A real trade-off** - genuine alternatives existed and one was chosen for specific reasons.

Typical qualifying choices include architectural shape, context integration patterns, technology choices with lock-in, ownership boundaries, deliberate deviations from the obvious path, non-code constraints, and non-obvious rejected alternatives.

## Select the ADR directory

When `docs/agents/domain.md` exists, use its configured directory. Otherwise:

- Use `docs/adr/` for a system-wide decision.
- Use `<context>/docs/adr/` for a context-specific decision.

Create the selected directory only when the first ADR is needed. Number ADRs sequentially within that directory: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, and so on.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what is the context, what was decided, and why?}
```

An ADR can be one paragraph. Its value is recording that a decision was made and why.

## Optional sections

Include additional material only when it helps a future reader understand the decision:

- **Status** frontmatter: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, or `superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Considered options** when rejected alternatives are worth remembering.
- **Consequences** when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out.

**Complete when:** the ADR meets all eligibility conditions, is in the correct directory with the next local number, and records the decision and its rationale without unsupported detail.
